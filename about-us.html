			<h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
			<br>
			<p2>We are a company specialized only in the sale of football jersey. When the company was founded in 1978, we equipped thousands of people with football equipment, but because of competitive brands we went bankrupt.<br> Recently I decided to reopen the company by specializing in football jerseys and honestly it is a frank success thanks to you.<br> This is why we try to sell the jerseys a little cheaper, and that there are often promo codes to thank you fidel customers!!! <br>As the reopening is recent, thatâ€™s why there are not all the jerseys, sorry. <br>We will do as quickly as possible to add a maximum.</p2>
